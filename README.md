## Project Description

The goal of this project was to use Spark SQL queries to ascertain information from a database of information about home sales. The data contained the following fields:
- An id for each house for sale
- The date the house was listed
- The year the house was built
- The final selling price of the house
- The number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and floors
- The square footage of living space, and the square footage of the lot
- Whether the house was on a waterfront
- How many times the house had been viewed

Spark SQL queries were written to collect the requested information, and these were practiced further after caching the data and partioning the data using parquet.
